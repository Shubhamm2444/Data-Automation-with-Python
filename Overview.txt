### Overview:
The project aims to simplify the process of cleaning raw datasets and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). By automating these tasks, users can save time, reduce errors, and generate meaningful insights.

### Code Explanation:

#### **1. Data Cleaning Functions**:
The data cleaning module includes functions to preprocess raw datasets by addressing common issues:
- **`clean_missing_values(df)`**:  
  Replaces missing values in the dataset with the column mean. This is a simple and commonly used strategy for handling missing data.

- **`standardize_columns(df)`**:  
  Standardizes column names by making them lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores. This makes the dataset easier to work with in Python.

- **`remove_outliers(df, column)`**:  
  Identifies and removes outliers in a specific column using the interquartile range (IQR) method, which is a robust way to detect extreme values.

- **`clean_data(df)`**:  
  Combines all the above functions to perform a complete data cleaning process.

#### **2. EDA Functions**:
The exploratory data analysis module provides tools to summarize and visualize the dataset:
- **`generate_summary(df)`**:  
  Computes and returns descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns in the dataset.

- **`plot_histogram(df, column)`**:  
  Creates a histogram with a kernel density estimate (KDE) overlay for a specified column. This visualization helps understand the data distribution.

- **`plot_correlation_matrix(df)`**:  
  Generates a heatmap of the dataset's correlation matrix. This visualization highlights relationships between numerical variables, making it easier to identify patterns or dependencies.

#### **3. Main Workflow (`main()` Function)**:
The `main()` function ties everything together:
1. **Load the Dataset**:  
   Reads a dataset from the `data/` directory. The file path can be updated based on the actual dataset location.

2. **Clean the Data**:  
   Calls the `clean_data()` function to process the raw dataset. The cleaned dataset is saved to the `output/` directory as `cleaned_data.csv`.

3. **Generate Summary Statistics**:  
   Prints descriptive statistics for the cleaned dataset, giving users a quick overview of the data.

4. **Visualizations**:  
   - Prompts the user to input a column name to generate a histogram. This allows for interactive exploration of data distributions.
   - Displays a heatmap of correlations to help users understand relationships between variables.

5. **Execution**:  
   The script is run by executing `main.py`, and users interactively provide inputs when prompted.

### Workflow in Action:
1. **Input Dataset**: Place your dataset (e.g., `sample_dataset.csv`) in the `data/` folder.
2. **Run the Script**: Use the terminal or command prompt to execute the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. **Outputs**:
   - **Cleaned Dataset**: Saved as `cleaned_data.csv` in the `output/` folder.
   - **EDA Insights**: Visualizations and statistics are displayed in the terminal and as plots.

---

### Key Benefits:
- **Efficiency**: Automates repetitive cleaning tasks, saving significant time.
- **Error Reduction**: Ensures consistent handling of missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Quickly summarizes data and provides visual tools to identify trends and patterns.
- **Scalability**: Can handle datasets of varying sizes and complexities.

### Customization and Enhancements:
1. **Customization**:
   - Modify `clean_missing_values()` to use other strategies (e.g., median, mode, or advanced imputations).
   - Add more visualizations like boxplots, pair plots, or time-series analyses.

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Include machine learning models to predict trends or classify data.
   - Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) or web-based application for easier usage.
